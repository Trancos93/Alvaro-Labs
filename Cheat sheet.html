                <h3>Cheat Sheet</h3>
                <p>This is the place were I write about the most important HTML and CSS tools that I've been using.</p>
                <p>As I keep getting better, I'll be adding more entries to this page.</p>
            
                <h3>Index</h3>
                    <p>In this part, I'm gonna create a breadcrumb list, just for the sake of practicing it:</p>
                <ul class="breadcrumb">
                    <li><a href="#environment">Setting up your environment</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#Planning">Plan ahead</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#divide">Divide problems into smaller ones</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#template">Create your own templates</a></li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>
            <article class="article">
                    <h3 id="environment">Setting up your environment</h3>
                         <p>First, and before we start coding, we need to settup everything we need to start working. Open a terminal and type in "Code", VS Code should open. Create a folder with the name of the project. Inside it, create an HTML file called "index.html".
                    Also, create a folder inside the project called "Resources", where we would save our images. Inside Resources, create a folder called "Fonts". Within VS Code, create a new file, called "Index.css" and save it into Resources. Open a live server of the html file.     
                        </p>
                        <p>Those would be the first steps I'd take before I started writing a single line of code. </p>
           
           
                    <h3 id="Planning">Plan ahead</h3>
                    <p>Never start coding before having a plan. Yo can have an idea, but for coding to be productive you need to have a cliear plan of how the website is going to be, how many menus are you going to create, what images are you going to use, etc... </p>
                    <p>You need to have 100% clear how the layout of the website is going to be. Once you've got that, you can start the proyect. </p>
          
         
                    <h3 id="divide">Divide problems into smaller and more manageable ones</h3>
                    <p>When we think about styling an HTML page, creating a new site or desingning a new function, they can be daunting tasks. However, I've found that, while creating this site for example, it's been extremely useful to divide every task. For instance,
                    creating the header would be a task, then I would focus my attention in the article/content section, I would afterwards focus on the footer, and so on. </p>
                    <p>The thing is, if you as a developer keep thinking about everything as a whole, and everything you still have to do to fully complete the proyect, it can be daunting and overwhelming. For this reason, focusing your attention on one aspect 
                    of the site at a time and dividing every piece of work into different sections, can help a whole lot in your developer journey. </p>

                    <h3 id="template">Create your own templates</h3>
                    <p>Templates allow us to create faster. They allow us to start working and save us some precious time from the creative part. In a template, a developer may save or store their favorite fonts, colors, or other elements so that  can recall that 
                        information faster and save some time.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I created a template featuring my favorite colors to date, the only font i've been lucky to use, the one and only (I saw it in another website and it caught my attention), and that's about it.</p>
