                <h3>What is this Site?</h3>
                <p>
                Welcome to my training room. This site is a place were I plan to show and practice my web development skills. Each section, heading or paragraph is crafted with tremendous effort, patience and will to learn from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                This is just the begining, the basic template which I'm going to keep upgrading over time. Right now, this is just some HTML5 and CSS3 basic elements that I've managed to pull off.

            <h3>How to Avoid Procrastination - Get things done</h3>

            <p>So how do we deal with one of the worst sins of modern society</p>

            <!--Parragraph one-->

            <p><strong>Customize and plan your day</strong></p>

            <p>Our brains spend around 1 fourth of our body's total energy. It's the reason why we iare more effective early in the morning. 
                Imagine our brains, full of willpower at the begining of the day, it would only make sense to do the harder tasks at this time of the day, when we are at our best, 
                leaving for the end of the day, the harder ones, when we are at our worst. Our brains' energy is not infinite, so managing it wisely is key to being productive, 
                Understanding your golder hours is a must if your goal is to start procrastinating less and getting things done. </p>

            <!--Parragraph two-->

            <p><strong>Take care of your sleep</strong></p>

            <p>Tied with the above, if we want our brains to be awake and productive, we need to care more about our sleep. Sleep depravation is the single worst pandemic that affects
                modern society, and it's the single most powerfull activity you can work on  to hack your performance in every other aspect of your life. Good sleep improves concentration, memory, creativity, 
                fisical performance, coordination, the list just goes on and on... Also, you'll have more of that energy we previously talked about.</p>
